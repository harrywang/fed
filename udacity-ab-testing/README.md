# About

This is one of the course projects from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The project is about an A/B testing about the conversion rates between new and old landing page for an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company decide whether the new page should be launched or they should run the experiment longer to collect more data.

The code is adapted based on:
